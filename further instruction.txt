Run the tests — they should all pass! Congratulations, you have a working card-matching game! Take some time customizing it to make it your own. Here are a few features you could add:

    Indicate that the user won when all pairs have been found
    Add a "Restart Game" button
    Only allow two cards to be visible at a time (currently the setTimeout allows users to click really quickly and see a few)
    Change card values to non-number values
    Add score or time
    Allow user to select from multiple board sizes
    Add sound effects
    Add flipping animations
